# Expected Outcomes for WordPress on ECS Example

This document outlines the expected outcomes when running the detection, analysis, and remediation scripts for the WordPress on ECS example. It provides a reference for validating that the example is working correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have:

1. Set up the infrastructure using the Terraform code in `setup/infrastructure/`
2. Configured the Datadog agent using the configuration in `setup/datadog/`
3. Set the required environment variables:
   ```bash
   export DATADOG_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   export DATADOG_APP_KEY="your-app-key"
   ```
4. Made the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

## Test Scenarios

The example includes test data for three common scenarios:

1. **CPU Spike**: Simulates high CPU utilization in the WordPress service
2. **Memory Leak**: Simulates a memory leak in a WordPress plugin

```
Root Cause Analysis Report

## Incident Overview
- Service: wordpress
- Environment: production
- Time Range: 1h
- Analysis Date: 2025-06-23 14:30:45 UTC

## Key Metrics
- Maximum CPU Usage: 92.4%
- Maximum Memory Usage: 2147483644 bytes
- Maximum Error Rate: 0 errors
- Maximum Database Queries: 120 queries/sec

## Log Analysis
- Total Log Entries: 4
- Database Errors: No
- PHP Errors: No

## Root Cause Determination

Based on the analysis of logs, metrics, and traces, the most likely root cause is:
**High CPU utilization**

The metrics show CPU usage exceeding 80%, which can lead to performance degradation and potential timeouts.

Possible specific causes:
1. Traffic spike exceeding current capacity
2. Inefficient WordPress plugins consuming excessive CPU
3. Poorly optimized database queries
4. Background processes consuming resources

Recommended actions:
1. Scale up the ECS service to handle the increased load
2. Review and optimize WordPress plugins
3. Implement caching to reduce CPU load
4. Optimize database queries
```

### Memory Leak Scenario

```bash
./scripts/analyze.sh wordpress production
```

**Expected Output (partial):**
```
Root Cause Analysis Report

## Root Cause Determination

Based on the analysis of logs, metrics, and traces, the most likely root cause is:
**PHP application errors**

The logs show PHP errors, which indicate issues with the WordPress application code.

Possible specific causes:
1. Plugin compatibility issues
2. Theme errors
3. WordPress core issues
4. PHP configuration problems

Recommended actions:
1. Review PHP error logs for specific error messages

- Maximum Error Rate: 25 errors
- Maximum Database Queries: 0 queries/sec

## Log Analysis
- Total Log Entries: 5
- Database Errors: Yes
- PHP Errors: No

## Root Cause Determination

Based on the analysis of logs, metrics, and traces, the most likely root cause is:
**Database connectivity issues**

The logs show database-related errors, and there are HTTP errors in the metrics. This suggests that the WordPress application is unable to connect to the database properly.

Possible specific causes:
1. Security group misconfiguration blocking database access
2. Database credentials issues
3. Database server performance problems
4. Network connectivity issues between the ECS tasks and the database

Recommended actions:
1. Verify security group rules allow traffic from ECS to the database
2. Check database credentials in the ECS task definition
3. Monitor database performance metrics for signs of overload
4. Check network connectivity between ECS and the database
```
