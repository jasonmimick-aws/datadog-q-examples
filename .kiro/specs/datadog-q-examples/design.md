# Design Document: Datadog Q Examples Library

## Overview

The Datadog Q Examples Library is a structured collection of practical examples demonstrating how Q CLI and Datadog can be integrated to solve real-world operational problems. This design document outlines the architecture, components, and implementation approach for creating a maintainable, extensible library that allows multiple contributors while ensuring consistency and quality.

The library will focus on end-to-end workflows that showcase incident detection, analysis, resolution, and documentation using Q CLI and Datadog's capabilities. Examples will be organized in a way that makes them discoverable, understandable, and adaptable to different environments.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Datadog Q Examples Library follows a modular, content-focused approach:

```mermaid

    A[Repository Root] --> B[Documentation]
    A --> C[Examples Library]
    A --> D[Contribution Tools]
    A --> E[Common Resources]
    
    C --> F[Category 1]
    C --> G[Category 2]
    C --> H[Category N]
    
    F --> I[Example 1.1]
    F --> J[Example 1.2]
    
    I --> K[Problem Statement]
    I --> L[Solution Design]
    I --> M[Implementation]
    I --> N[Validation]
    I --> O[Resources]
    
    D --> P[Templates]
    D --> Q[Validation Scripts]
    D --> R[Contribution Guide]
    
    E --> S[Shared Scripts]
    E --> T[Common Configurations]
    E --> U[Test Data]
```

### Key Architectural Decisions:

1. **Content-First Approach**: The architecture prioritizes content organization and discoverability over complex technical implementations.

2. **Modular Structure**: Each example is self-contained but follows a consistent structure, allowing for independent development and maintenance.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between example content, documentation, and contribution tooling.

4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Examples should have minimal external dependencies to ensure they remain functional over time.

5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Examples are structured to provide basic implementation first, with optional advanced configurations.
