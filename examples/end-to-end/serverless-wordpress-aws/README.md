# Serverless WordPress on AWS with Datadog

## Problem Statement

Running WordPress in a traditional server environment often leads to operational challenges including server maintenance, scaling issues during traffic spikes, and cost inefficiencies during low-traffic periods. Organizations need a solution that provides the flexibility and familiarity of WordPress while leveraging modern serverless architecture to reduce operational overhead, improve scalability, and optimize costs.

This example demonstrates how to deploy a serverless WordPress installation on AWS using ECS Fargate and Aurora Serverless, with comprehensive monitoring through Datadog. It also showcases how to use Q CLI to detect, analyze, and remediate common issues that may arise in this architecture.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with administrator access
- AWS CLI v2.0+ configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform v1.0+
- Docker installed locally
- Datadog account with API and Application keys
- Q CLI v1.0+
- Basic knowledge of WordPress, AWS services, and Datadog

## Solution Overview

This solution implements WordPress in a serverless architecture on AWS, using ECS Fargate for compute and Aurora Serverless for the database. The implementation includes Datadog monitoring for comprehensive observability and Q CLI integration for incident management.

### Architecture

The solution uses the following AWS services:
- Amazon ECS Fargate for running WordPress containers
- Aurora Serverless for the MySQL database
- Amazon EFS for persistent storage of WordPress files
- Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- AWS Secrets Manager for credential management
- Amazon CloudFront for content delivery (optional)

Datadog integration provides:
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Log management
- Synthetic monitoring
- Incident detection and alerting

### Components

1. **WordPress Container**: Custom Docker image with WordPress and the Datadog agent
2. **Database**: Aurora Serverless MySQL-compatible database
3. **File Storage**: Amazon EFS for WordPress media and plugin files
4. **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
5. **Monitoring**: Datadog for comprehensive observability
6. **Incident Management**: Q CLI for analysis and remediation

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. Deploy networking components (VPC, subnets, security groups)
2. Create Aurora Serverless database
3. Set up EFS file system
4. Configure Application Load Balancer

### Phase 2: WordPress Deployment
1. Build WordPress Docker image with Datadog agent
2. Configure ECS task definition and service
3. Set up auto-scaling policies
4. Deploy WordPress containers

### Phase 3: Datadog Integration
1. Configure Datadog agent in ECS task
2. Set up log collection
3. Implement APM for WordPress
4. Create dashboards and monitors

### Phase 4: Q CLI Configuration
1. Set up Q CLI for the environment
2. Configure analysis workflows
3. Implement remediation scripts

## Expected Outcomes

When successfully implemented, this example provides:

### Metrics
- ECS Fargate CPU and memory utilization
- Aurora Serverless database performance metrics
- WordPress application performance metrics
- Request latency and throughput

### Logs
- ECS container logs
- WordPress application logs
- Database logs
- Load balancer access logs

### Alerts
- High CPU/memory utilization
- Database connection issues
- WordPress error rates
- Slow page load times

## Validation and Testing

Detailed steps for validating the deployment will be provided, including:
1. Accessing the WordPress site
2. Verifying Datadog metrics collection
3. Testing auto-scaling capabilities
4. Validating Q CLI incident workflows

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions will be documented, including:
- Container startup failures
- Database connectivity issues
- WordPress configuration problems
- Datadog agent connectivity issues

### Known Issues
- Initial EFS mount may cause slower container startup
- Aurora Serverless cold starts can impact performance after idle periods

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize WordPress for containerized environments
- Configure appropriate auto-scaling thresholds
- Use page caching for improved performance
- Consider CloudFront for global content delivery

## Security Considerations
- Secure database credentials using AWS Secrets Manager
- Implement appropriate IAM roles and policies
- Configure security groups with least privilege access
- Enable WordPress security best practices

## Educational Notes
- This example demonstrates the "shared responsibility model" in serverless architectures
- The solution showcases how traditional applications can be modernized with serverless technologies
- The monitoring setup illustrates the importance of observability in distributed systems
