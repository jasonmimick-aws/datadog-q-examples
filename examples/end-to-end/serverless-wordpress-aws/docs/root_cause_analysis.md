# Root Cause Analysis Workflow

This document outlines the process for conducting root cause analysis (RCA) on incidents in the serverless WordPress deployment using Q CLI and Datadog.

## RCA Process Overview

The root cause analysis process follows these steps:

1. **Incident Detection**
   - Identify the incident through alerts or monitoring
   - Gather initial information about the symptoms

2. **Data Collection**
   - Collect logs, metrics, and traces from Datadog
   - Gather system and application state information

3. **Analysis**
   - Analyze the collected data to identify patterns
   - Correlate events across different data sources
   - Identify potential root causes

4. **Verification**
   - Test hypotheses about the root cause
   - Verify findings through targeted investigation

5. **Resolution**
   - Implement a fix for the root cause
   - Verify the fix resolves the issue

6. **Documentation**
   - Document the incident, root cause, and resolution
   - Update runbooks and knowledge base

## Using the RCA Script

The `analyze.sh` script in the `scripts` directory automates the data collection and initial analysis steps. It performs the following actions:

1. Collects logs, metrics, and traces from Datadog
2. Analyzes the data for patterns and anomalies
3. Generates a root cause analysis report

### Running the RCA Script

```bash
# Set Datadog API and Application keys
export DATADOG_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export DATADOG_APP_KEY="your_app_key"

# Run the analysis script
./scripts/analyze.sh [service_name] [environment] [incident_id] [time_range]
```

Example:
```bash
./scripts/analyze.sh wordpress production INC-12345 1h
```

### Understanding the RCA Report

The RCA report includes:

1. **Incident Overview**
   - Service and environment information
   - Time range analyzed
   - Analysis date

2. **Key Metrics**
   - Maximum CPU usage
   - Maximum memory usage
   - Maximum error rate
   - Maximum database queries

3. **Log Analysis**
   - Total log entries
   - Presence of database errors
   - Presence of PHP errors

4. **Root Cause Determination**
   - Most likely root cause based on the analysis
   - Possible specific causes
   - Recommended actions

## Common Root Causes and Analysis Patterns

### 1. Database Connectivity Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Database connection errors in logs
- HTTP 500 errors
- Zero database connections metric

**Data Collection:**
```bash
./scripts/analyze.sh wordpress production INC-12345 1h
```

**Analysis Patterns:**
- Look for database error messages in logs
- Check for security group changes
- Verify database instance status
- Check network connectivity

**Verification:**
- Attempt to connect to the database from the ECS task
- Check security group rules
- Verify database credentials

### 2. High CPU Utilization

**Symptoms:**
- CPU usage consistently above 80%
- Increased response times
- Potential task restarts

**Data Collection:**
```bash
./scripts/analyze.sh wordpress production INC-12345 1h
```

**Analysis Patterns:**
- Check for traffic spikes in access logs
- Look for resource-intensive WordPress plugins
- Analyze slow database queries
- Check for background processes

**Verification:**
- Profile the WordPress application
- Temporarily disable plugins
- Monitor CPU usage during different operations

### 3. Memory Leaks

**Symptoms:**
- Gradually increasing memory usage
- Eventual container restarts
- Performance degradation over time

**Data Collection:**
```bash
./scripts/analyze.sh wordpress production INC-12345 3h
```

**Analysis Patterns:**
- Look for memory growth patterns
- Check for PHP memory limit errors
- Identify memory-intensive operations
- Look for plugin-related memory issues

**Verification:**
- Monitor memory usage over time
- Test with different WordPress configurations
- Isolate specific plugins or themes

## Using Q CLI for Advanced Analysis

Q CLI provides advanced capabilities for root cause analysis:

### Analyzing Logs

```bash
q analyze logs --service wordpress --time-range 1h --pattern "database error"
```

This command analyzes logs for specific patterns and provides insights into the frequency and context of errors.

### Correlating Metrics

```bash
q correlate metrics --service wordpress --metrics cpu,memory,errors --time-range 1h
```

This command identifies correlations between different metrics to help understand cause-and-effect relationships.

### Generating Recommendations

```bash
q recommend --incident-type database-connectivity --service wordpress
```

This command generates specific recommendations for resolving the identified issue based on best practices and historical data.

## Documenting RCA Findings

After completing the root cause analysis, document the findings using the following template:

```markdown
# Incident RCA: [Incident ID]

## Incident Summary
- Date/Time: [Incident date and time]
- Duration: [Incident duration]
- Impact: [Description of the impact]
- Severity: [Severity level]

## Root Cause
[Description of the root cause]

## Timeline
- [Time]: [Event]
- [Time]: [Event]
- [Time]: [Event]

## Resolution
[Description of the resolution]

## Lessons Learned
- [Lesson 1]
- [Lesson 2]
- [Lesson 3]

## Action Items
- [ ] [Action item 1]
- [ ] [Action item 2]
- [ ] [Action item 3]
```

## Next Steps

After completing the root cause analysis, proceed to the remediation phase to implement a fix for the identified issue. See the [Remediation Guide](./remediation.md) for details.
