# datadog-q-examples

Idea to build library of examples using Q automation and Datadog to solve problems.

This is a work in progress.

## Initial Prompt

```
Hi - I would like to build a project which will contain a library of examples. These examples will show how to use Q cli and Datadog to solve real world problems. For example, a customer is running a workload on AWS and errors occur which cause application outages. Using the features of Q cli and Datadog customers can be alerted to the issue, discusover the root cause, have Q cli and Datadog help deisng and fix the issue, deploy a change, document the process and resolve the incident. 

Can you generate a design doc and PRFAQ for such a project. The over all project should allow multiple developers to submit examples which are in a structured format and easy for customers to follow and resuse in their own environments.
```
