# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a structured library of examples demonstrating how Q CLI and Datadog can be used together to solve real-world problems. The examples will showcase end-to-end workflows for incident detection, root cause analysis, resolution, and documentation. The library will be designed to allow multiple developers to contribute examples in a consistent format, making it easy for customers to follow and adapt these solutions to their own environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Example Library Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized structure for the examples library, so that examples are easy to discover, understand, and contribute to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user browses the repository THEN the system SHALL present a clear organization of examples by category, use case, or problem domain.
2. WHEN a user selects an example THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent structure including problem statement, solution approach, implementation steps, and expected outcomes.
3. WHEN a developer wants to contribute a new example THEN the system SHALL provide clear templates and guidelines for contribution.
4. WHEN a user navigates the examples THEN the system SHALL provide cross-references between related examples.
5. WHEN a user views the repository THEN the system SHALL provide a search or filtering mechanism to find relevant examples.

### Requirement 2: Example Content and Quality

**User Story:** As a customer, I want comprehensive, high-quality examples that demonstrate real-world scenarios, so that I can understand how to apply Q CLI and Datadog to my own environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views an example THEN the system SHALL provide a clear problem statement that describes a realistic scenario.
2. WHEN a user follows an example THEN the system SHALL include all necessary code, configuration, and commands to reproduce the solution.
3. WHEN an example demonstrates integration between Q CLI and Datadog THEN the system SHALL clearly explain the interaction points and data flow.
4. WHEN a user implements an example THEN the system SHALL provide expected outcomes and verification steps.
5. WHEN a user views an example THEN the system SHALL include explanations of key concepts and decision points.
6. WHEN a user follows an example THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance for common issues.

### Requirement 3: End-to-End Incident Management Workflow

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want examples that demonstrate the complete incident lifecycle using Q CLI and Datadog, so that I can implement effective incident management in my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views incident management examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate alert configuration in Datadog.
2. WHEN an incident is detected THEN the system SHALL show how Q CLI can be used to analyze logs, metrics, and traces.
3. WHEN root cause is identified THEN the system SHALL demonstrate how Q CLI can assist in designing and implementing a fix.
4. WHEN a fix is implemented THEN the system SHALL show deployment processes with appropriate validation.
5. WHEN an incident is resolved THEN the system SHALL demonstrate documentation and knowledge capture processes.
6. WHEN viewing examples THEN the system SHALL include post-incident analysis and prevention strategies.

### Requirement 4: Multi-Environment Support

**User Story:** As a customer with diverse infrastructure, I want examples that work across different environments, so that I can apply solutions regardless of my specific setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views examples THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which environments (AWS, GCP, Azure, on-premises) are supported.
2. WHEN an example is environment-specific THEN the system SHALL provide clear prerequisites and assumptions.
3. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL provide alternative implementations for different environments.
4. WHEN an example requires specific versions of tools THEN the system SHALL clearly document version dependencies.
5. WHEN an example involves cloud resources THEN the system SHALL include infrastructure-as-code templates where appropriate.

### Requirement 5: Contribution Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a streamlined process for contributing new examples, so that I can easily share my knowledge and solutions with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer wants to contribute THEN the system SHALL provide clear contribution guidelines and templates.
2. WHEN a new example is submitted THEN the system SHALL enforce quality standards through review processes.
3. WHEN examples are contributed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency in structure and documentation.
4. WHEN multiple developers contribute THEN the system SHALL prevent duplication and encourage collaboration on similar examples.
5. WHEN a developer submits an example THEN the system SHALL provide automated validation of format and completeness.

### Requirement 6: Educational Value

**User Story:** As a learner, I want examples that not only solve problems but also teach me about Q CLI and Datadog capabilities, so that I can build expertise while implementing solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user follows an example THEN the system SHALL explain why specific approaches were chosen.
2. WHEN a feature of Q CLI or Datadog is used THEN the system SHALL provide context about that feature's purpose and capabilities.
3. WHEN advanced techniques are employed THEN the system SHALL include progressive learning paths from basic to advanced usage.
4. WHEN a user completes an example THEN the system SHALL suggest next steps for expanding knowledge.
5. WHEN appropriate THEN the system SHALL include links to relevant documentation and learning resources.

### Requirement 7: Reproducibility and Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want examples that are fully reproducible and tested, so that I can trust they will work in my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an example is included in the library THEN the system SHALL ensure it has been fully tested in relevant environments.
2. WHEN an example includes code or configuration THEN the system SHALL provide validation methods to verify correct implementation.
3. WHEN dependencies change THEN the system SHALL have processes to update and re-validate examples.
4. WHEN an example requires test data THEN the system SHALL provide sample data or clear instructions for generating appropriate test data.
5. WHEN an example might impact production systems THEN the system SHALL include clear warnings and safety precautions.
